Client
======

This directory contains the sources for a client to the Address Book
application.

It uses [npm][] to manage the dependencies. We use [grunt][] to
automate various tasks.

Setup
-----

The following command downloads the dependencies that [grunt] needs to
do its magic.

    npm install

In order to execute grunt you need a globally installed
`grunt-cli`. It can be installed with

    npm install -g grunt-cli

[npm]: https://npmjs.org/
[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/
